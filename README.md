Morse Code Flasher

A simple Javascript application that will display a black screen, take a given input and display that in Morse code in the form
of long and short yellow flashes.

The application converts the input message into Morse code using a predefined mapping of characters to Morse code symbols. 
It then flashes the screen accordingly


The speed of the flashes can be adjusted by changing the timeUnit variable in the JavaScript code.
